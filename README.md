# Active-Directory-Lab Environment with Mass User Provisioning




This project demonstrates the deployment of an Active Directory (AD) environment with a single Domanin Controller configured to support 1,000 pre-created user accounts, all using a shared default password. The user accounts were automatically generated using a custom PowerShell script, which creates accounts in bulk based ona naming convention. All users are able to sign on to the same computer, ideal lab environments, testing scenarios, or demonstrations of AD authentication and group policy behavior.



This a visusal representation of the network Setup.
